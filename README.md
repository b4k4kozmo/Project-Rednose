Time is flowing constantly, feeling as if it is constantly moving faster and faster as we grow.

This program takes into account how the perception of time changes as we grow older using a simple equation to compare:
AgeA/AgeB * Time = AgeBPerception

usage: ./rednose
When ran through the command line you will be asked to input ages, unit of time, and time.
It will out put the perception of the first age you enter compared to the second age

example:
  Enter the age you want to check the perception of
  31

  Enter the age you want to compare it to
  4

  Type a unit of time
  seconds

  Enter an amount of seconds
  120

  120 seconds for a 4 year old would feel like 15.4839 seconds to a 31 year old.

Later I will add more features with an epoch system that can be broken up into 8-bits
Epoch0: age 0-1
Epoch1: age 1-3
Epoch2: age 3-7
Epoch3: age 7-15
Epoch4: age 15-31
Epoch5: age 31-63
Epoch6: age 63-127
Epoch7: age 127-255

This will be used to help entertain new ways of thinking and comparing the life cycle to an 8-bit system to help answer
questions about learning, living, spirituality and philosophy
